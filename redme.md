Determining the Height of a Building Using Trigonometry

1. Introduction
Trigonometry helps in real-life applications like construction and surveying. This paper determines the height of a building using the angle of elevation and a known horizontal distance.

2. Problem Setup
Distance from observer to building: 45 m
Angle of elevation: 37.8°
Observer’s eye level: 1.65 m
The goal is to find the total height of the building.
3. Calculations
Using Tangent Function:
We use the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to height and distance:

37.8

)
=
ℎ

45
tan(37.8°)=

m
h2=45×tan(37.8°)=45×0.7745=34.85m
Adding the observer’s eye level height:

H=h2+h1=34.85+1.65=36.49m
Thus, the total height of the building is 36.49 meters.

Verification Using Sine and Cosine:
Hypotenuse (L) using sine:

​
 ⇒L= 
sin(37.8°)

​
 =56.84m
Horizontal distance using cosine confirms the result:

 ⇒L=56.84m
4. Conclusion
Using trigonometric functions, we determined the building’s height is 36.49 meters. Verification with sine and cosine confirmed the calculation. This method is essential in fields like surveying and architecture.
